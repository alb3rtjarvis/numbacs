LCSs are most repelling, attracting and shearing material lines that form the centrepieces of observed tracer patterns in two-dimensional unsteady dynamical systems.

After a review of the underlying theory, we explain the steps and numerical methods used by LCS Tool, and illustrate its capabilities on three unsteady fluid flow examples.}

  abstract = {This paper develops the theory and computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), which are defined as ridges of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields. These ridges can be seen as finite-time mixing templates. Such a framework is common in dynamical systems theory for autonomous and time-periodic systems, in which examples of LCS are stable and unstable manifolds of fixed points and periodic orbits. The concepts defined in this paper remain applicable to flows with arbitrary time dependence and, in particular, to flows that are only defined (computed or measured) over a finite interval of time. Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of FTLE fields and the associated LCSs for revealing the Lagrangian behavior of systems with general time dependence. However, ridges of the FTLE field need not be exactly advected with the flow. The main result of this paper is an estimate for the flux across an LCS, which shows that the flux is small, and in most cases negligible, for well-defined LCSs or those that rotate at a speed comparable to the local Eulerian velocity field, and are computed from FTLE fields with a sufficiently long integration time. Under these hypotheses, the structures represent nearly invariant manifolds even in systems with arbitrary time dependence. The results are illustrated on three examples. The first is a simplified dynamical model of a double-gyre flow. The second is surface current data collected by high-frequency radar stations along the coast of Florida and the third is unsteady separation over an airfoil. In all cases, the existence of LCSs governs the transport and it is verified numerically that the flux of particles through these distinguished lines is indeed negligible.}

We also define weak LCSs (WLCSs) as stationary solutions of the above variational problem. Solving these variational problems, we obtain computable sufficient and necessary criteria for WLCSs and LCSs that link them rigorously to the Cauchy–Green strain tensor field. We also prove a condition for the robustness of an LCS under perturbations such as numerical errors or data imperfection. On several examples, we show how these results resolve earlier inconsistencies in the theory of LCS. Finally, we introduce the notion of a Constrained LCS (CLCS) that extremizes normal repulsion or attraction under constraints. This construct allows for the extraction of a unique observed LCS from linear systems, and for the identification of the most influential weak unstable manifold of an unstable node.}

Unfortunately, vector field topology has no straightforward extension to unsteady flow, and the concept probably most closely related to the topological skeleton are the so-called Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). LCS are material lines or material surfaces that separate regions of different flow behavior. Ideally, such structures are material lines (or surfaces) in an exact sense and at the same time maximally attracting or repelling, but practical realizations such as height ridges of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) fulfill these two requirements only in an approximate sense. In this paper, we quantify the deviation from exact material lines/surfaces for several FTLE-based concepts, and we propose a numerically simpler variants of FTLE ridges that has equal or better error characteristics than classical FTLE height ridges.",

These ridges represent time-dependent separatrices of the flow and are also called Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). LCS have been demonstrated to be an effective way to analyze realistic time-chaotic flows, although they can be quite complex. Therefore, in order to exploit the information that LCS can provide it is important to locate and characterize these structures in a systematic way. This can be accomplished by interpreting the FTLE as a height field and detecting the LCS as ridges of this graph. Methodologies developed in the image processing framework are integrated with dynamical system inspired approaches in order to characterize ridge strength and location. The main novel contribution of the proposed algorithm is a scheme to connect sets of points into curves or surfaces (rather than distributions of points around a ridge axis) and classify these curves or surfaces using a dynamical systems measure of strength. This approach provides the capability to track ranked LCS in space and time. The results are presented for a simple analytical model and noisy LCS from realistic three-dimensional geophysical fluid data. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The unidirectional method is shown to be fast and accurate, although it is memory intensive.

  ABSTRACT = {Reduced order models (ROMs) are computational models whose dimension is significantly lower than those obtained through classical numerical discretizations (e.g., finite element, finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods). Thus, ROMs have been used to accelerate numerical simulations of many query problems, e.g., uncertainty quantification, control, and shape optimization. Projection-based ROMs have been particularly successful in the numerical simulation of fluid flows. In this brief survey, we summarize some recent ROM developments for the quasi-geostrophic equations (QGE) (also known as the barotropic vorticity equations), which are a simplified model for geophysical flows in which rotation plays a central role, such as wind-driven ocean circulation in mid-latitude ocean basins. Since the QGE represent a practical compromise between efficient numerical simulations of ocean flows and accurate representations of large scale ocean dynamics, these equations have often been used in the testing of new numerical methods for ocean flows. ROMs have also been tested on the QGE for various settings in order to understand their potential in efficient numerical simulations of ocean flows. In this paper, we survey the ROMs developed for the QGE in order to understand their potential in efficient numerical simulations of more complex ocean flows: We explain how classical numerical methods for the QGE are used to generate the ROM basis functions, we outline the main steps in the construction of projection-based ROMs (with a particular focus on the under-resolved regime, when the closure problem needs to be addressed), we illustrate the ROMs in the numerical simulation of the QGE for various settings, and we present several potential future research avenues in the ROM exploration of the QGE and more complex models of geophysical flows.},

Identifying the mechanisms by which the dust is transported across the Atlantic is crucial for obtaining a complete understanding of these important events. Of these events, the so-called “Godzilla” dust intrusion of June 2020 was the largest and most impactful in the last two decades and underwent a particularly interesting transport pattern. By uncovering dominant, organizing structures derived from the wind velocity fields, known as Lagrangian coherent structures, we demonstrate the ability to describe and qualitatively predict certain aspects related to the evolution of the dust plume as it traverses the atmosphere over the Atlantic. In addition, we identify regions of high hyperbolicity, leading to drastic changes in the shape of the plume and its eventual splitting. While these tools have been quite readily adopted by the oceanographic community, they have still yet to fully take hold in the atmospheric sciences and we aim to highlight some of the advantages over traditional atmospheric transport methods.}

    abstract = "{Furthermore, traditional trajectory analysis focuses on full trajectory histories that yield convoluted “spaghetti plots” that are hard to interpret. Improved understanding and forecasting therefore requires new concepts and methods that provide more insight into why fluid flows behave as they do.To predict the outcomes of such events, the standard approach is to run numerical simulations of the atmosphere or the sea and use the resulting velocity-field data sets to forecast pollutant trajectories. Although that approach does predict the future of individual fluid parcels, the predictions are highly sensitive to small changes in the time and location of release. Attempts to address the excessive sensitivity to initial conditions include running several different models for the same scenario. But that typically produces even larger distributions of advected particles—those transported by the fluid flow—and thus hides key organizing structures of that flow.}",
