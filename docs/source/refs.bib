abstract = {This paper develops the theory and computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), which are defined as ridges of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields. These ridges can be seen as finite-time mixing templates. Such a framework is common in dynamical systems theory for autonomous and time-periodic systems, in which examples of LCS are stable and unstable manifolds of fixed points and periodic orbits. The concepts defined in this paper remain applicable to flows with arbitrary time dependence and, in particular, to flows that are only defined (computed or measured) over a finite interval of time. Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of FTLE fields and the associated LCSs for revealing the Lagrangian behavior of systems with general time dependence. However, ridges of the FTLE field need not be exactly advected with the flow. The main result of this paper is an estimate for the flux across an LCS, which shows that the flux is small, and in most cases negligible, for well-defined LCSs or those that rotate at a speed comparable to the local Eulerian velocity field, and are computed from FTLE fields with a sufficiently long integration time. Under these hypotheses, the structures represent nearly invariant manifolds even in systems with arbitrary time dependence. The results are illustrated on three examples. The first is a simplified dynamical model of a double-gyre flow. The second is surface current data collected by high-frequency radar stations along the coast of Florida and the third is unsteady separation over an airfoil. In all cases, the existence of LCSs governs the transport and it is verified numerically that the flux of particles through these distinguished lines is indeed negligible.}

An alternative approach to coherent structures is shown to lead to their characterization as local maximizers of the largest finite-time Lyapunov exponent field computed directly from particle paths. Both approaches provide effective tools for extracting distinguished Lagrangian structures from three-dimensional velocity data. We illustrate the results on steady and unsteady ABC-type flows.}

abstract = {We develop a mathematical theory that clarifies the relationship between observable Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) and invariants of the Cauchy–Green strain tensor field. Motivated by physical observations of trajectory patterns, we define hyperbolic LCSs as material surfaces (i.e., codimension-one invariant manifolds in the extended phase space) that extremize an appropriate finite-time normal repulsion or attraction measure over all nearby material surfaces. We also define weak LCSs (WLCSs) as stationary solutions of the above variational problem. Solving these variational problems, we obtain computable sufficient and necessary criteria for WLCSs and LCSs that link them rigorously to the Cauchy–Green strain tensor field. We also prove a condition for the robustness of an LCS under perturbations such as numerical errors or data imperfection. On several examples, we show how these results resolve earlier inconsistencies in the theory of LCS. Finally, we introduce the notion of a Constrained LCS (CLCS) that extremizes normal repulsion or attraction under constraints. This construct allows for the extraction of a unique observed LCS from linear systems, and for the identification of the most influential weak unstable manifold of an unstable node.}

This approach eliminates false positives and negatives in LCS detection by separating true exponential stretching from shear in a frame-independent fashion.

We find that even large velocity errors lead to reliable predictions on Lagrangian coherent structures, as long as the errors remain small in a special time-weighted norm.

abstract="The popularity of vector field topology in the visualization community is due mainly to the topological skeleton which captures the essential information on a vector field in a set of lines or surfaces separating regions of different flow behavior. Unfortunately, vector field topology has no straightforward extension to unsteady flow, and the concept probably most closely related to the topological skeleton are the so-called Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). LCS are material lines or material surfaces that separate regions of different flow behavior. Ideally, such structures are material lines (or surfaces) in an exact sense and at the same time maximally attracting or repelling, but practical realizations such as height ridges of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) fulfill these two requirements only in an approximate sense. In this paper, we quantify the deviation from exact material lines/surfaces for several FTLE-based concepts, and we propose a numerically simpler variants of FTLE ridges that has equal or better error characteristics than classical FTLE height ridges.",

abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes an algorithm to detect and characterize ridges in the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field obtained from a continuous dynamical system or flow. These ridges represent time-dependent separatrices of the flow and are also called Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). LCS have been demonstrated to be an effective way to analyze realistic time-chaotic flows, although they can be quite complex. Therefore, in order to exploit the information that LCS can provide it is important to locate and characterize these structures in a systematic way. This can be accomplished by interpreting the FTLE as a height field and detecting the LCS as ridges of this graph. Methodologies developed in the image processing framework are integrated with dynamical system inspired approaches in order to characterize ridge strength and location. The main novel contribution of the proposed algorithm is a scheme to connect sets of points into curves or surfaces (rather than distributions of points around a ridge axis) and classify these curves or surfaces using a dynamical systems measure of strength. This approach provides the capability to track ranked LCS in space and time. The results are presented for a simple analytical model and noisy LCS from realistic three-dimensional geophysical fluid data. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The unidirectional method is shown to be fast and accurate, although it is memory intensive. The bidirectional method is also fast and uses significantly less memory; however, it is prone to error which is large in regions where the opposite-time FTLE field is large, rendering it unusable.
